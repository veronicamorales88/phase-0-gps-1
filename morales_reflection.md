What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was having a hard time with merging, version control, and creating new branches. It can get confusing to understand the workflow and the reasoning behind the code not working. 
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The merging conflict and working on different branches. 
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked the guide the difference between branches? How to push to GitHub and how to work and merge the master branch and other branches. 
What still confuses you about Git? I am not so much confused. I need more practice and learning via trial and error. 
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? It was great! I learned a lot and both my pair and GPS guide were nice and helpful.
